# Podjetni≈°ki klub Style Guidelines

This document outlines the style rules for the TeleFinder project. It is essential that all design and development decisions adhere to these guidelines to ensure a cohesive, modern, and professional look across the entire website.

## 1. Global Colors

- **Color Palette:**  
  Every color used must be one of the colors defined in `globals.css`. No additional colors are allowed.
- **Usage:**  
  Always reference colors using CSS variables (or classes) defined in `globals.css` to ensure consistency.

  Modern Tech Aesthetic
Overall Look:
The design should convey a modern, sleek, and tech-inspired vibe. Think clean lines, minimalism, and a professional appearance.
The view should look good on all screens desktop tablet and mobile.

Typography & Spacing:
Use modern, sans-serif fonts and maintain ample white space. All text should be easily readable, and the layout should be uncluttered.

Visual Elements:
Utilize subtle animations, crisp icons, and high-quality imagery that supports the modern tech theme.


Buttons and Interactive Elements
Border Radius:
All buttons should have a border radius set to 1


Animations and Transitions
Primary Method:
Use CSS for animations and transitions whenever possible (e.g., @keyframes and CSS transitions) to ensure smooth performance and simplicity.

Entrance Animations:
All CSS animations intended for element entrance effects (such as fade-ins, slide-ins, etc.) must be defined in globals.css and referenced from there. This centralizes the animation definitions and ensures consistency across the website.

When to Use Framer Motion:
Framer Motion should only be used for complex interactive animations that cannot be effectively achieved with CSS alone.

General Principles:

Subtlety: Animations must enhance the user experience without being distracting.

Consistency: Use similar timing, easing, and duration across the website for uniformity.

Performance: Avoid heavy animations that could negatively affect page performance.
